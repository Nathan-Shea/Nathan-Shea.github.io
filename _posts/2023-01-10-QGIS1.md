## My Very First QGIS Module

So this is my very first [QGIS training module.](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/training_manual/basic_map/index.html) This was a relatively easy module as I have done a bit of stuff in QGIS before. A couple important things I have learned:
- Using Geopackages
- Managing Symbology Layers
- The Importance of Nice Sybology
- That I am having trouble picking colours easily. (something to look into!)

To see the finished product, visit my [github page.](https://github.com/Nathan-Shea/QGIS-Training-Manual/blob/main/QGIS-Training-Data-release_3.22/solution/2%20Creating%20and%20Exploring%20a%20Basic%20Map)
