# A small Python snippet

## Caluclating percentage change

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/2023-03-06-Python/pylogo.jpeg)

Just a quick little update, Uni has been asking alot of questions that require working out the percentage change between two numbers. Instead of constantly opening the calculator or excel I wrote this little code to make my life easier:

```python
v1 = float(input("Enter V1: "))
v2 = float(input("Enter V2: "))
change = ((v2-v1)/v1*100)
print(change)
```
